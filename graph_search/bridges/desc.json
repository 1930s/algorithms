  "Bridges": "An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects the graph. A naive solution to finding bridges in a graph is to:<br />1.Delete an edge E<br />2.Perform DFS Exploration to check if the Graph is still connected<br />3.Restore Edge E. E is a bridge only if DFS exploration determines that the graph is disconnected without E",
