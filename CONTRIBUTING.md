## Learning About Tracers

[`tracers`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers) is the visualization library we use to visualize codes.

There are five tracers in the library to visualize different types of data.

- [Array1DTracer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki/Array1DTracer)
- [Array2DTracer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki/Array2DTracer)
- [ChartTracer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki/ChartTracer)
- [GraphTracer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki/GraphTracer)
- [LogTracer](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki/LogTracer)

There are also randomizers to help you create random data.

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers/wiki) in [`tracers`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers) repo for more information.

## Running on Scratch Paper

At the bottom left corner of [algorithm-visualizer.org](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/), there is Scratch Paper where you can visualize your own code.

We highly encourage you to test your visualization on Scratch Paper several times before creating a pull request.
