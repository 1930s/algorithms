# Binary Search
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by comparing the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the lower or upper half of the array is eliminated depending on the result and the search is repeated in the remaining subarray until it is successful.

## Applications
* Finding values in a sorted collection
* Traversing binary search trees

## Complexity
* **Time**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(log(N))), best ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(1)), average ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(log(N)))
* **Space**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(log(N))) - recursive, ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(1)) - iterative
