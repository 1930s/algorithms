# Bellman-Ford
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is different from Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm because it allows NEGATIVE weights unlike Dijkstra's.

## Applications
* Packet Routing - A variation of BF is used in the Distance vector Routing Protocol

## Complexity
* **Time**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(|V|\cdot|E|))
* **Space**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(|V|))
