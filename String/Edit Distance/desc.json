# Edit-Distance
Given two strings str1 (length M) and str2 (length N) and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert str1 into str2.<br />Insert<br />Remove<br />Replace<br />All of the above operations are of equal cost

## Applications
* Displaing Near-Proximity Words
* Information Retrieval (eg- Lucene API)
* Natural Language Processing

## Complexity
* **Time**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(|M|\cdot|N|))
* **Space**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(|M|\cdot|N|))
